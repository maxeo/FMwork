                                                                                    In high school I studied pedagogy, but it wasn't my way, so during the school time I studied <b>HTML</b>, <b>PHP</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
                                                                                    I worked as a typesetter for the label manufacturer <a href="http://www.ogasrl.it/"><b>Oga</b></a> for three years, and here I made some little programs for the company like custom calculators, work diary or utility.<br>
