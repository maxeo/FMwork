                        My name is Matteo Burbui, I was born in Figline Valdarno August 17, 1990. At the moment I live in San Giovanni Valdarno.<br>
                        In high school I studied pedagogy, but it wasn't my way, so during the school time I studied <b>HTML</b>, <b>PHP</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
                        I worked as a typesetter for the label manufacturer <a href="http://www.ogasrl.it/"><b>Oga</b></a> for three years, and here I made some little programs for the company like custom calculators, work diary or utility.<br>
                        Even though I had a good salary and all in all it was not bad, after three years, I decided to go back to school, I began enrolling to computer engineering.
                        At first I did it both ways: in the morning I went to school and in the afternoon I returned to work using a little at a time of day off.
                        After the first quarter, given that my expectation I request was refused, I left work.<br>
                        The next year, because my mother has a nursery and then it was a bit in difficulty because of a maternity I went to work for her as an educator and administrator at <a href="http://www.ifollettidelbosco.it/"><b>Asilo Nido I Folletti del Bosco</b></a>.<br>
                        I have here also been busy in computing, writing the <a href="http://www.ifollettidelbosco.it/">website of the nursery</a> and optimizing a bit the SEO.<br>
                        After the maternity nursery I took vat. Now he works as a computer consultant.
